Community Meeting 1
===

Notes
---

- Brad is currently the game master but we're trying to figure out who this is.
- Please put issues about rules are put in issues and separated out into individual issues.
- There is a needs-discussion label which we will then use as an agenda for the meetup.
- starter snake is education so maybe not the game master is responsible?
  We will support 4 starter snakes and have lists of the other peoples.
  Starter snakes should have json handling, but no logic.
  John is going to be the starter snake wrangler.
- You can now run engine in docker for development.
- We need a place on the website for open roles.
- Lets add open roles on the community
