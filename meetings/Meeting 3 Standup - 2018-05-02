Standup Meeting

Notes
---

- Daniel load testing (10 works, 100 games = 15 seconds, local snakes) worker = go routine.  Talked about budgeting and we can set it live.  We shouldn't need a large node size.
- John - updates for starter snakes
- Will - bot merged, need help to delpoy onto heroke. setup meeting to discuss write access to board repo with Graeme Hill.
- Colin - added chaos flag which adds random network latency for simulation testing between controller and worker.  Storage backing may make things more consistent.     e2e tests merged in.  Found some bugs.  
- Torben - No updates.  we're able to run more than one server instance right? Daniel - yep, once we have persistence store.
- Brad - nothing of consequence - Startup Calgary is interested in running a Battlesnake in January.  
- PRs reviewed.
- Needs discussion reviewed.
- Would be nice to find a UI designer.  Noah post about this and talk to dominique
- Need GCP name servers to update DNSimple to point at google cloud.
- Looking at Mage for cross-platform go based make.
