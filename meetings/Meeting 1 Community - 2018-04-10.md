- How often are these meetings?
- We have three front-ends - elixir = go engine.  Current front end it will be written not in elm.
- We do have a designer that has agreed to give some time.
- Do we have a date for the API code freeze - Not at the moment, but we hope it will be mostly unchanging definitely by the announcement for the event.
- Are we going to have the starter snakes?  Absolutely, we just have to move them in and get them updated.
  Maybe we need a version number ofr starter snakse to make sure they're not falling behind.
  We can put in the README.md a deploy to heroku for all the starter snakes.
  Video tutorials.  Twitch streams.
  Would be nice on the battlesnake page a link ot all the starter snakes.
  If there is a java snake it needs a bit more for the deploy to heroku.
- What about a file in community for external tools and resources? +1
