# Battlesnake Community

Welcome to the Battlesnake community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Battlesnake community - improving docs, improving code, competing etc.

Each of the folders marked `repo_***` are descriptions of each of the active repositories that we manage and who the owners are.

## Communicating

The Battlesnake community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._
