# Battlesnake Community

Welcome to the Battlesnake community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Battlesnake community - improving docs, improving code, competing etc.

Each of the folders marked `repo_***` are descriptions of each of the active repositories that we manage and who the owners are.

## Code of Conduct

The Battlesnake community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the Battlesnake community leaders here: 
https://goo.gl/forms/fAS1scsZuOp221HO2

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If thatâ€™s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
